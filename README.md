# Scripts
 
I originally made these scripts for myself, so they aren't perfect and might not work on every OS.

Feel free to make an issue if it doesn't work on your OS, so I can look into making it work for your OS.

## Required programs

Please look at [this](SCRIPT-REQUIREMENTS.md) to see what programs each script requires.
 
## Usage

All you have to do to run a script is run this commands. (Replace "script-name" with the script name)

`./script-name.sh`

## Tested on

Here is a list of operating systems these scripts were tested on:

* macOS 
* CentOS 7/8
* Debian 10
